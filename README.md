This project builds from a static display of departing trains through multiple statges to an entire station pasenger information display with dynamic depatures and arrivals which are cleared form the screens when there scheduled time has passed.
The the screens used are SSD1306 128x64 Pixel OLED Display Module which can be purchssed here: https://hobbycomponents.com/displays/400-ssd1306-128x64-pixel-oled-display-module-white
They use the following library: https://github.com/HobbyComponents/HCuOLED
