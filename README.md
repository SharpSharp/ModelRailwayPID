This project builds from a static display of departing trains through multiple statges to an entire station pasenger information display with dynamic depatures and arrivals which are cleared form the screens when there scheduled time has passed.

A detailed description about the development and functionally of these sketches is avaliable at https://blog.hobbycomponents.com There is one blog post for each of the 6 sketches.
  
The screens used are SSD1306 128x64 Pixel OLED Display Module which can be purchssed here: https://hobbycomponents.com/displays/400-ssd1306-128x64-pixel-oled-display-module-white  
  
They use the following library: https://github.com/HobbyComponents/HCuOLED
